About

Being still an initial release, must be considered alpha software and handled 
with care. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!

The aim of PixClip is to integrate as seamlessly as possible with the OS to 
allow users to easily capture clips to file or to the clipboard. Check out 
the Windows version and features at: http://www.pixclip.net

This version of PixClip is aimed to be Gnome Desktop compliant, although 
integration with the K Desktop Environment is also intended.
